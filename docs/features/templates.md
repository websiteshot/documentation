Websiteshot offers the possibility to define so-called screenshot templates. These templates represent the configuration for a complete screenshot job. The advantage over a screenshot job that is completely specified via the API is the separation between integration and job definition. The API request in the integration can be reduced accordingly and only has to reference the `TemplateId`. On the other hand, URLs or parameters can be changed without touching the integration.

A list of all created templates can be reached via the Websiteshot Console. In the overview, new templates can be created, existing templates can be changed or deleted.

In addition, a new screenshot job can be started for a template. A filter function can be used to display all screenshots for a specific template.
