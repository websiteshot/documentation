This sounds like a no-brainer, but it's essential and simplifies the automation of your screenshots. No one wants to start a dedicated action for each URL to generate a screenshot. Websiteshots supports the possibility to generate multiple screenshots at once. Therefore all URLs have to be configured in the job. This job generates all screenshots in the backend, which can then be processed further.

In the Websiteshot Console, each job appears in the menu. The job details show all screenshots that belong to this collection.

Make even more out of the collections by using [templates](./templates.md)!
